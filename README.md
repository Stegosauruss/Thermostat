Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
```
as a user
so that the temperature is reasonable when switched on
I would like the thermostat to have a starting value

You can increase the temperature with an up function

as a user
if I feel a bit chilly
I would like an up function for the thermostat

You can decrease the tempreature with a down function

if I'm sweating my tits off
I would like a down function for the thermostat

The minimum tempereatute is 10 degrees

So I don't freeze to death
I would like a minimum temperature of 10 degrees
```

If power saving mode is on the max temperature is 25 degrees
```
as a user
so I'm not solely responsible for global warming
I would like power saving mode to set the max temperature to 25 degrees
```

If power saving mode is off the max temperature is 32 degrees
```
as a user
So I don't melt like a wax candle
I would like non power saving to have a max temperatu
```

Power saving mode is on by default
```
as a user
Because I have no self control
I would like power saving to be on as default
```

You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
```
as a user
Because I get confused easily
I would like to be able to reset the temperature to 20
```

You can ask about the thermostats current energy usage < 18 is low usage < 25 is medium usage anything else is high usage
```
as a user
When I've lost the plot completely
I would like to check how much power the themostat is using
```

Low usage will be indicated with green, medium with black, high with red
```
as a user
because I hate amber
Set the colors to exactly my specifications
